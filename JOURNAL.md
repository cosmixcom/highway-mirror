I started off looking for monitors that I could use for the display of my smart mirror. I checked Amazon and AliExpress, I was surprised to find that Amazon had better deals. I chose this monitor https://a.co/d/4JCQb6j.

I also started looking for some mirror film and found it on Amazon https://a.co/d/hO9mkkn.

I started looking for a small computer and camera to run my mirror AI on. The device just needs to be capable of running a web browser for my software.

I tried to find the cheapest computer that had the required specs. The Orange Pi Zero 2W seems to be a good option https://a.co/d/hv1vMaV. Since the Orange Pi doesn't have a dedicated CSI port for a camera, I plan to use a webcam I actually found better deals on webcams than CSI cameras. Here is the one I think would do the job https://a.co/d/d4MfLSU

For the project, I want an ambient light sensor to detect when someone approaches the mirror. This is so I can dim and brighten the screen. It took a while to find a sensor that would work with the Orange Pi, but I think this one does and meets all the requirements.
